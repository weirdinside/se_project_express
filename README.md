# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This project uses express.js and mongoDB to create a backend for a website designed in a previous sprint during the TripleTen bootcamp. The website it is used on is designed to show users possibly clothing garments to wear based on the weather. This backend utilizes bcrypt and JWT to authenticate users logging in, and allows them to view, like & unlike, add and delete images.
